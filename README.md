- `data`: contains simulation input and output files
- `benchmarking_sims`: contains code and analysis to determine # cycles vs error for GCMC simulations and Henry Coefficients.
- `htc_screening`: contains code to run and analyze the high-throughput comuptational screening of the COFs in `./data/crystals`.
- `descriptors`: contains the scritps used to generate the data used in training the Gaussian Process.


The paper associated with the top performing COF is:
p1944,"J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2019, 141, 16810-16816",10.1021/jacs.9b07644,Unveiling Electronic Properties in Metalâ€“Phthalocyanine-Based Pyrazine-Linked Conjugated Two-Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks
In the paper they report on two novel COFs on with Zn and one with Cu. The COF with Cu is the 19440N2 (top COF) and the Zn COF is 19441N2.
