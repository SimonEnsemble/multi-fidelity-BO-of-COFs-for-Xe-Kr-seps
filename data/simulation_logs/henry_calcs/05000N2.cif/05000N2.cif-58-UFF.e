┌ Info: Crystal 05000N2.cif has  space group. I am converting it to P1 symmetry.
└         To afrain from this, pass `convert_to_p1=false` to the `Crystal` constructor.
┌ Warning: Assignment to `results` in soft scope is ambiguous because a global variable by the same name exists: `results` will be treated as a new local. Disambiguate by using `local results` to suppress this warning or `global results` to assign to the existing global variable.
