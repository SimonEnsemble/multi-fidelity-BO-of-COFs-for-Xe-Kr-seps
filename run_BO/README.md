**TODO:**
Notebooks:
1. `generate_initializing_cof_ids.ipynb`: This is a jupyter notebook containing code to generate the sets of COF used to initialize the models in the `*_BO` notebooks. 
2. `MultiFidelity_BO.ipynb`: This is a jupyter notebook containing the code used to perform the Multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimization searches.
    - this notebook contains a flag to run the multi-fidelity ablation study for testing the model dependence on the features.
3. `SingleFidelity_BO.ipynb`: This is a jupyter notebook containing the code used to perform the Single-fidelity Bayesian Optimization searches and the single-/high-fidelity random search. 
4. `ordinary_ML.ipynb`:
