    "## System Description\n",
    "1. We have a set of COFs from a database. Each COF is characterized by a feature vector $$x_{COF} \\in X \\subset R^d$$ were d=14.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We have **two different types** of simulations to calculate **the same material property $S_{Xe/Kr}$**. Therefore, we have a Single-Task/Objective (find the material with the optimal selevtivity), Multi-Fidelity problem. \n",
    "    1. low-fidelity  = Henry coefficient calculation - MC integration - cost=1\n",
    "    2. high-fidelity = GCMC mixture simulation - 80:20 (Kr:Xe) at 298 K and 1.0 bar - cost=30\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We will initialize the system with *two* COFs at both fidelities in order to initialize the Covariance Matrix.\n",
    "    - The fist COF will be the one closest to the center of the normalized feature space\n",
    "    - The second COF will be chosen at random\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Each surrogate model will **only train on data acquired at its level of fidelity** (Heterotopic data). $$X_{lf} \\neq X_{hf} \\subset X$$\n",
    "    1. We could use the augmented EI acquisition function from [here](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00158-005-0587-0.pdf)\n",
    "    2. We could use a naive implementation of the [misoKG](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2017/file/df1f1d20ee86704251795841e6a9405a-Paper.pdf) acquisition function\n",
    "    3. **OR** we could use the acquisition function from the [tutorial](https://botorch.org/tutorials/discrete_multi_fidelity_bo)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **kernel model**: \n",
    "    1.  We need a Gaussian Process (GP) that will give a *correlated output for each fidelity* i.e. we need a vector-valued kernel\n",
    "    2. Given the *cost aware* acquisition function, we anticipate the number of training points at each fidelity *will not* be equal (asymmetric scenario) $$n_{lf} > n_{hf}$$\n",
    "        - perhaps we can force the symmetric case, $n_{lf} = n_{hf} = n$, if we can include `missing` or `empty` entries in the training sets."
