This directory contains the multi-fidelity search results using the normalized feature vectors. 
The sub-directories and files are as follows:
- `mfbo_results`: This directory contains the results dictionaries (as `.pkl` files) for performing the Multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimization search using the normalized feature vectors.
- `sfbo_results`: This directory contains the results dictionaries (as `.pkl` files) for performing the Single-fidelity Bayesian Optimization search using the normalized feature vectors.
- `initializing_cof_ids.pkl`: This file contains the sets of initializing COFs used in all BO searches.
- `random_search_resulrs.pkl`: This file is the results dictionary for performing an ensemble of high-fidelity random searchs on the entire pool of COFs.
