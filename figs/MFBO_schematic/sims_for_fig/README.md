Run three simulations using the same COF for each and print snapshots:
1. Henry in COF with Xe
2. Henry in COF with Kr
3. GCMC in COF with Xe:Kr at 1.0 bar and 298 K. This can be a very short simulation


The choice of COF is completely arbitrary. 
These simulations are performed by executing the `sims_for_fig1.jl` using `Julia`.


The positions of all the molecules are saved in the final state of each simulation and visualized in the material using the iRASPA v 2.2.5. 
The figures can be regenerated by loading the project files with the file extention `.irspdoc`.
