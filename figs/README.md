# analysis and visualizations

All plots in the main text are generated by running the `viz.ipynb` and are deposited here. 

- `viz.ipynb`: THis is the notebook which generates the plots and analysis for figures in the main text.
- `MFBO_schematic` contains figures and data used to generate TOC images and the Single-fidelity curve in Figure 1 of the paper. 
- `pca_dynamics`: contains the shell script and to generate a GIF from the the MFBO search represented in PCA space. Note, the `figs_for_gif` flag must be turned on in the `viz.ipynb` for the required images to be generated and deposited in the directory.
- `top_cofs`: The visualization of the top COF is done using iRASPA. A project file for this can be found in the `top_cof` directory. Launch iRASPA and load the `xtal_viz.irspdoc` project file. The settings will (should) load with all of the required files to generate the COF image.
- `Xe_Kr_separation_with_COFs`: contains files and code to generate the graphic in Box 1 of the main text.
- `top_COF_feature_vectors.jld2`: a file containing the raw features for the optimal COF which is used by `voz.ipynb` to generate the radar plot in the main text.
