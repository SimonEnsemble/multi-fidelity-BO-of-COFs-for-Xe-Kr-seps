- All plots in the main text are generated by running the `viz.ipynb` and are deposited here. 

- The visualization of the top COF is done using iRASPA. A project file for this can be found in the `top_cof` directory, so you can just launch iRASPA and load the project file and the settings will (should) load in with all the required files to generate the COF image.

- Similarly, project files to generate figure 1 in the text are located in the `figure_1` directory. 


- `MFBO_schematic` contains figures and data used to generate TOC image and the Figure 1 in the paper.
